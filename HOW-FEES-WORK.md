# üí∞ How Fee Collection Actually Works

## üéØ **The Complete Fee Flow**

When a user executes a trade, here's **exactly** what happens with fees:

### Step 1: User Initiates Trade
```
User command: /execbuy 0x123...abc 0.1 1.5 3000
- User wants to spend: 0.1 ETH
- Slippage: 1.5%
- Fee tier: 3000 (0.3%)
```

### Step 2: Fee Calculation & Deduction
```javascript
// System calculates fee based on user tier
const originalAmount = 0.1 ETH
const userTier = 'FREE_TIER' // or PRO_TIER, WHALE_TIER
const feePercent = userTier === 'WHALE_TIER' ? 0.15% : 0.3%

// Fee calculation
const feeAmount = 0.1 * 0.003 = 0.0003 ETH (0.3%)
const netAmount = 0.1 - 0.0003 = 0.0997 ETH

// User's wallet is charged: 0.1 ETH total
// But only 0.0997 ETH goes to token purchase
// 0.0003 ETH is the fee that will be transferred
```

### Step 3: Token Purchase
```javascript
// Execute Uniswap swap with NET amount
router.exactInputSingle({
  tokenIn: WETH,
  tokenOut: userToken,
  amountIn: 0.0997 ETH,  // Net amount after fee
  recipient: userWallet,
  // ... other params
})
```

### Step 4: Fee Transfer to Treasury
```javascript
// After successful swap, transfer fee to your wallet
userWallet.sendTransaction({
  to: "YOUR_TREASURY_WALLET",  // Your actual wallet address
  value: 0.0003 ETH,           // The collected fee
  gasLimit: 21000              // Standard ETH transfer
})
```

## üí≥ **Where Your Fees Go**

### Your Treasury Wallet Address
- **Current**: `0x742d35Cc4Bd4E1C3a29c7c2F7b2C7A8D7E2C8E2F` (CHANGE THIS!)
- **Location**: `.env` file ‚Üí `TREASURY_WALLET=your_wallet_address`
- **Access**: You have the private key, you control this wallet

### Two Transactions Per Trade
1. **Trade Transaction**: User swaps NET amount for tokens
2. **Fee Transaction**: Fee amount transfers to YOUR wallet

Both visible on BaseScan with separate transaction hashes.

## üìä **Tracking & Monitoring**

### Bot Commands
- `/treasury` - Check your treasury wallet balance & status
- `/revenue` - View total fees collected & analytics  
- `/tier` - Users can see their fee rates

### Database Tracking
Every fee is recorded in `revenue_tracking` table:
- User ID and tier
- Fee amount in ETH and USD
- Original trade amount  
- Timestamp and metadata
- Associated trade transaction

## üîß **Configuration**

### Required Setup (.env file)
```bash
# YOUR wallet where fees go
TREASURY_WALLET=0xYourActualWalletAddress

# Your Telegram ID for admin commands  
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=123456789

# Fee collection settings
FEE_COLLECTION_ENABLED=true
AUTO_FEE_TRANSFER=true
MIN_FEE_TRANSFER=0.001
```

### Fee Collection Settings
- **FEE_COLLECTION_ENABLED**: Turn fee collection on/off
- **AUTO_FEE_TRANSFER**: Automatically transfer fees after each trade
- **MIN_FEE_TRANSFER**: Only transfer fees above this threshold

## üí∞ **Revenue Examples**

### Example 1: Small Trade
```
User trade: 0.01 ETH
Fee (0.3%): 0.00003 ETH
Status: Below minimum (0.001 ETH) - fee accumulated
Action: Fee stored, will transfer when threshold reached
```

### Example 2: Normal Trade  
```
User trade: 0.5 ETH
Fee (0.3%): 0.0015 ETH  
Status: Above minimum
Action: 0.0015 ETH transferred immediately to your wallet
```

### Example 3: Whale User
```
User trade: 1.0 ETH (Whale tier)
Fee (0.15%): 0.0015 ETH
Status: 50% discount applied  
Action: 0.0015 ETH transferred to your wallet
```

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Update Your Treasury Wallet**

**Before going live:**

1. **Edit `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   TREASURY_WALLET=0xYourActualWalletAddress
   ```

2. **Set your admin chat ID**:
   ```bash
   ADMIN_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_user_id
   ```

3. **Test fee collection**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   /treasury  # Check treasury status
   ```

## üîç **Monitoring Your Revenue**

### Real-time Monitoring
- Every successful trade = automatic fee transfer
- Check `/treasury` for current balance
- Monitor transaction logs for fee transfers

### Expected Revenue
- **Per Trade**: 0.3% of trade volume (or 0.15% for whales)
- **Daily**: Depends on user activity and trade sizes
- **Growth**: Scales directly with user adoption and volume

## ‚úÖ **Ready Checklist**

- [ ] Update `TREASURY_WALLET` in `.env` to your wallet
- [ ] Set `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` to your Telegram user ID
- [ ] Test with small trade to verify fee collection
- [ ] Monitor `/treasury` command for balance updates
- [ ] Check BaseScan for fee transfer transactions

**Your fees will start collecting immediately once the system is configured!** üí∞
